# How do I use this?

Check [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code)
on how to write good AI prompts.

For example with cursor inside a function, type command [:AIA](#:AIA):

```typescript
function capitalize (str: string): string {
    <cursor>
}
```

Will result in:

```typescript
function capitalize (str: string): string {
    return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
```

For example:

```
:AIA write a thank you email to Bigco engineering interviewer
```

Results in something like:

```
Dear [Name],

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for taking the time to interview me for the engineering
position at Bigco. I was very impressed with the company and the team, and I am excited about the
possibility of joining the team.

I appreciate the time you took to explain the role and the company's mission. I am confident that I
have the skills and experience to be a valuable asset to the team.

Once again, thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

Besides generating new text, you can also edit existing text using a given instruction.

```css
body {
    color: orange;
    background: green;
}
```

Visually selecting the above CSS and running `:AIE convert colors to hex` results in:

```css
body {
    color: #ffa500;
    background: #008000;
}
```

Another example of text editing:

```
List of capitals:
1. Toronto
2. London
3. Honolulu
4. Miami
5. Boston
```

Visually selecting this text and running `:AIEdit sort by population` results in:

```
List of capitals:
1. London
2. Toronto
3. Boston
4. Miami
5. Honolulu
```
