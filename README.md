## How do I use this?

Read [https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/code)
on how to write good AI prompts.

### Completion


:AI

:  Chat with AI using [chats/completions OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).
 The response will be printed at cursor position.
 The chat conversations history is saved into `global.cache_dir/kai/chat*.json` files.
 Chat history is send to chats/completion API reduced to the `chat_max_tokens` number of tokens.
    - To keep below maximum number of tokens allowed and also to reduce number of tokens you pay for.
    - The calculation of tokens is approximate, because really counting tokens would be too hard.
 I use this for prompting simple stuff, like `:AI how to write lua function that does something...?`
 then I can polish the results by asking follow up questions.
 I can use this freely, because it does not send company proprietary code to OpenAI.


:AIA

:  Mnemonic from AI Add.
 This is the main command that I use for filling up unfinished functions.
 By default takes 20 lines before position and 20 lines after the cursor position.
 Sends that to [completions OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions).
 The response from API is added into the buffer at cursor position.
 Command takes a prompt
   - `:AIA write code here that changes the world`
   - The prompt is added to the before part with two newline and three backticks.
 Command takes a single number
   - A single number specifies the number of lines before and after cursor position to send to the API.
       - `:20AIA` is the default. For example: `:40AIA` `:1000AIA`
       - The single number does _not_ represent the line number, I decided that is useless.
 Command takes a line range
   - A range specifies the number of lines to send the API.
       - `:-20,+10AIA` `:%AIA` `:'<,'>AIA`
       - Takes the selection and split it on cursor position for before and after sections.


:AIChatList

:  Lists the chats


:AIChatNew

:  Starts a new chat with specific name and prompt.


:AIChatOpen

:  Opens the current chat, or given an argument open the chat with the name


:AIChatRemove

:  Remove the chat with the name.


:AIChatUse

:  Selects a chat history file to use by name. The "default" chat is the default.


:AIChatView

:  Print chat contents


:AIE

:  Mnemonic from AI Edit.
 Uses [edits OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/moderations).
 Just `:AIA`, by default sends 20 lines before and after cursor position.
 Takes prompt sends as instruction.
 I typically select text and use `:'<,'>AIE do this`.
 `%AIE do this`


:AIEText

:  Like `:AIE` but uses `text-davinci-edit-001` model instead of `code-davinci-edit-001`.


:AIModel

:  Switch model used by AI


## Tutorial

For example:

```typescript
function capitalize (str: string): string {
    <cursor><type :AIA>
}
```

Will result in:

```typescript
function capitalize (str: string): string {
    return str.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + str.slice(1);
}
```

For example:

```
:AIA write a thank you email to Bigco engineering interviewer
```

Results in something like:

```
Dear [Name],

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for taking the time to interview me for the engineering
position at Bigco. I was very impressed with the company and the team, and I am excited about the
possibility of joining the team.

I appreciate the time you took to explain the role and the company's mission. I am confident that I
have the skills and experience to be a valuable asset to the team.

Once again, thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

Besides generating new text, you can also edit existing text using a given instruction.

```css
body {
    color: orange;
    background: green;
}
```

Visually selecting the above CSS and running `:AIE convert colors to hex` results in:

```css
body {
    color: #ffa500;
    background: #008000;
}
```

Another example of text editing:

```
List of capitals:
1. Toronto
2. London
3. Honolulu
4. Miami
5. Boston
```

Visually selecting this text and running `:AIEdit sort by population` results in:

```
List of capitals:
1. London
2. Toronto
3. Boston
4. Miami
5. Honolulu
```
